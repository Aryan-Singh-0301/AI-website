                <h2>What Is AI?</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence, also known as AI, instructs a computer to mimic the logical capabilities and actions of the 
                human mind. It is similar to using computers to understand humans such as monitors in medicine however it isn’t limited 
                to biomedical use. Currently AI is designed to think and act just like humans, however the long term goal is to have 
                AGI(Artificial General Intelligence) and ASI(Artificial Super Intelligence) which would be able to think more logically 
                and rationally compared to humans. Through specializing in predicting results and solving problems, AI typically makes 
                use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning, two key aspects of Computer Science.

                There are 2 main types of AI being, Strong AI and Weak AI. Weak AI also known as Narrow AI or 
                ANI(Artificial Narrow Intelligence), is when AI is trained to perform one specific task or a set series of tasks and has 
                a narrow list of capabilities, hence the name Narrow AI. Currently ANI is the most popular form of AI because of how much 
                simpler it is compared to Strong AI, which is currently not possible with our limited knowledge.

                In contrast, Strong AI uses Artificial General Intelligence(AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence(ASI) in order to think 
                like humans or better and to have their own consciousness. AGI is a theoretical segment of AI that would be able to think 
                logically and solve problems to the same degree as humans if provided with the same data.

                ASI is a step up from AGI and is a theoretical AI with the abilities that surpass the capabilities of the human brain. 
                Currently Strong AI is completely theoretical however many researchers are hard at work trying to design these AI

                Machine Learning is a sub-field of AI and is a key part of computer science and the fundamentals behind most current AI. 
                Machine learning is very dependent on humans to intervene and help it function and would require much more structured 
                data sets specifically tailored to the problem. However, Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning and is made up of 
                many different neural networks which allows for less dependency on human interaction and stronger capabilities to evolve. 
                The Deep in Deep Learning, refers to the ability to have more than 3 layers inclusive of input and output, essentially making 
                it a more sufficient and scalable version of Machine Learning, allowing for more, larger Neural Networks, increasing the 
                capabilities of the AI. Essentially the more scalable the AI is, the more Neural Networks it has, and the larger those neural 
                networks are which results in greater ability to evolve, thereby increasing the extent of that AIs potential.

                Deep Machine Learning or Supervised Learning is a subset of Machine Learning and Deep Learning which allows the AI to 
                take in raw data and can use linear and logistic regression models in order to help predict the outcomes and categorize 
                the incoming data. Linear regression finds the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent 
                variables in order to make predictions about future outcomes. 1 dependent variable and 1 independent variable make up 
                simple linear regression whereas if there is more than one independent variable there it would be multiple linear 
                regression. Both regressions seek to find a linear line of best fit using the data provided. Logistic regression is 
                used when the dependent variable is categorical and therefore has binary inputs such as “true/false” or “yes/no”. 
                Logistic models just like linear models seek to find the relationships between data inputs, however, logistic regression 
                is used more in binary classification. Overall, Supervised Learning is much more scalable and doesn’t need human 
                intervention in order to work and can distinguish features of data sets in more interesting ways.
