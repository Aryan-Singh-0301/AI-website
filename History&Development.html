        <h1>History and Development of AI</h1>
        <h2>1900-1966</h2>

            In the first half of the 20th century science fiction movies gave the world multiple instances of artificial intelligence and artificial civilizations. 
            After a surge of popularity in the field many scientists started to delve into the world of AI. 
            Although due to low funding, high costs and many sceptics, AI didn't really surge in worldwide popularity until much later. 
            In the 1950s one key researcher was a man by the name of Alan Turing. 
            He proposed that if provided with the same amount of information as humans, machines should theoretically be able to solve problems in the same way as humans.
            He suggested this in a paper called 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', where he talked about the capabilities of computers and how he could build and test computer intelligence.
            He proposed a test in which the computer would be put against a human to see who could solve a problem faster and with greater accuracy, this test would be known as the Turing Test.
            Unfortunately, back then computers couldn't store commands and information like they can now, this fundamentally prevented AI from progressing alongside the high cost for computing this meant that AI could not progress until computers were fundamentally changed.
            In 1955, the concept of AI was proven through 3 scientists by the names of; Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw, and Herbert Simon.
            They designed the Logic Theorist which was made to mimic human problem solving and was presented to the world at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence(DSRPAI), hosted by John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky in 1956.
            The confrence was intended to be a place where researchers could work together adn share ideas to progress the development of AI however it didn't play out how Marvin and John expected.
            Even though the confrence may not have gone as intended, it undeniably had a significant impact on the development of AI and kickstarted the next 20 years of AI research.

            From 1957 to 1974 there were many successes alongside many failures and setbacks in the world of AI, however, the DSRPAI had convinced parts of the government to fund a lot of AI research and Marvin Minsky boldly stated ini 1970; 'from 3 to 8 years we will have a machine with the intelligence of an average human being.'
            However, with how weak computers were back then the interest, hype, patience and funding all exponentially diminished.
            In the 1980s, the hype for AI had finally reignited, and for 2 key reasons; one being a boost of funds, and another being, an expansion of the algorithmic toolkit.
            John Hopfield and David Rumelhart popularized 'Deep Learning', which allowed computers to learn through trial and error.
