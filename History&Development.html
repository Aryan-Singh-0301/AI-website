                In the first half of the 20th-century science fiction movies gave the world multiple instances of artificial intelligence and artificial civilizations. 
                After a surge of popularity in the field many scientists started to delve into the world of AI. Although due to low funding, 
                high costs and many skeptics, AI didn't surge in worldwide popularity until much later.

                    In the 1950s one key researcher was a man by the name of Alan Turing. 
                    He proposed that if provided with the same amount of information as humans, machines should theoretically be able to solve problems in the same way as humans. 
                    He suggested this in a paper called 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', 
                    where he talked about the capabilities of computers and how he could build and test computer intelligence. 
                    He proposed a test in which the computer would be put against a human to see who could solve a problem faster and with greater accuracy, 
                    this test would be known as the Turing Test. Unfortunately, back then computers couldn't store commands and information as they can now, 
                    this fundamentally prevented AI from progressing alongside the high cost for computing; 
                    this meant that AI could not progress until computers were fundamentally changed. 
                    In 1955, the concept of AI was proven through 3 scientists by the names of; Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw, and Herbert Simon. 
                    They designed the Logic Theorist which was made to mimic human problem solving and was presented to the world at the 
                    Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence(DSRPAI), hosted by John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky in 1956. 
                    The conference was intended to be a place where researchers could work together and share ideas to progress the development of AI 
                    however, it didn't play out how Marvin and John expected. Even though the conference may not have gone as intended, 
                    it undeniably had a significant impact on the development of AI and kickstarted the next 20 years of AI research.

                From 1957 to 1974 there were many successes alongside many failures and setbacks in the world of AI, 
                however, the DSRPAI had convinced parts of the government to fund a lot of AI research and Marvin Minsky boldly stated in 1970; 
                'from 3 to 8 years we will have a machine with the intelligence of an average human being.' 
                However, with how weak computers were back then the interest, hype, patience and funding all exponentially diminished. 
                In the 1980s, the hype for AI had finally reignited, and for 2 key reasons; 
                one being a boost of funds, and another being, an expansion of the algorithmic toolkit. 
                John Hopfield and David Rumelhart popularized 'Deep Learning', which allowed computers to learn through trial and error around the 1980s. 
                From then till the current day there have been many different achievements, the most notable of which include, 
                IBM's Deep Blue AI beating the world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, IBM AI beat the Jeopardy champions in 2011, 
                Baidu Minwa Supercomputer using a deep neural network called a convolutional neural network to sort and identify images better than most humans, 
                and DeepMind's AlphaGo AI powered by a deep neural network beat the world Go champion in a 5 game match resulting to over 14.5 trillion possible moves.

                Although AI hasn't gotten any smarter in the past 30 years, 
                the technological and scientific restrictions preventing growth in the field have started to be overcome 
                and we are starting to be able to reach further extents of AI's power. In this golden day and age of technology, 
                AI is everywhere and helps many industries such as banking, marketing and entertainment. 
                In the future, it is expected that AI will fully automate many things such as phone calls and driving and 
                after enough research is done even AGI and ASI may come to light allowing the creating of smarter than human technology.
